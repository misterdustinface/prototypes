Player controls are WASD. W moves forward, S moves backward. A and D rotate you.

World controls are "1" and "2". 1 increases the number of rays used and 2 decreases the number of rays used. It's fucking awesome to play with, especially as the number of rays goes down to a very low number.
(I set bounds of # of rays from 1 - 600).

You can scale the window as you please.
