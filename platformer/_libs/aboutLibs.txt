    Summary: Helper Utilities for a Multitude of Problems is a set of lightweight helpers for the 
             awesome LÖVE Engine.  hump differs from other libraries in that every component is 
             independent of the remaining ones. hump's footprint is very small and thus should fit 
             nicely into your projects.

HardonCollider
    Website:       http://vrld.github.io/HardonCollider/reference.html#hardoncollider.class        
    Git download:  git clone git://github.com/vrld/HardonCollider.git
    Summary: It can detect collisions between arbitrary positioned and rotated shapes. Those 
             shapes can either be circles or polygons. Any non-intersecting polygons are 
             supported, even concave ones.

             The main interface is simple:
                Define collision callbacks,
                Add shapes to the scene and
                Update HardonCollider every frame.
                
    Note: includes Hump's class and vector-light in its project
